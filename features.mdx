  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Criteria" icon="list">
    Add scoring categories.

````json
{
  "criteria": [
    "Technique": { "max": 10, "weight": 0.4 },
    "Execution": { "max": 10, "weight": 0.3 },
    "Artistry": { "max": 10, "weight": 0.3 }
  ]
}

## Real-time Scoring Input and Calculations

Input scores live during performances. The app auto-calculates totals, applies deductions, and flags anomalies like scores `<6.0` in high-difficulty elements.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pole Scoring" icon="activity">
    Focus on spins and climbs.

    ```javascript
    // Example score input
    const poleScore = {
      technique: 8.5,
      execution: 9.0,
      artistry: 7.8,
      deductions: -0.5  // Minor balance issue
    };
    const total = (8.5 * 0.4) + (9.0 * 0.3) + (7.8 * 0.3) - 0.5;  // 8.37
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Aerial Scoring" icon="wind">
    Emphasize drops and transitions.

    ```javascript
    // Aerial example
    const aerialScore = {
      technique: 9.2,
      execution: 8.7,
      artistry: 9.5,
      deductions: -1.0  // Drop deduction
    };
    const total = (9.2 * 0.4) + (8.7 * 0.3) + (9.5 * 0.3) - 1.0;  // 9.07
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Video Playback Integration for Review

Integrate competition footage for post-performance review. Scrub to timestamps matching scored elements and adjust scores collaboratively.

<Expandable title="Advanced Sync Features" default-open="false">
  - Timestamp linking: Jump to `{elementStart}` and `{elementEnd}`
  - Multi-judge averaging: Auto-compute consensus scores
  - Slow-motion review for deductions `>0.5`
</Expandable>

## Exporting and Sharing Score Sheets

Generate and share detailed score sheets. Choose formats for judges, competitors, or officials.

<CodeGroup tabs="JSON,CSV,PDF">
